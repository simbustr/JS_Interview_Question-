// The JavaScript Math object is a built-in object that has properties and methods for mathematical constants and functions. Itâ€™s not a function object, so it cannot be invoked as a constructor, and its properties and methods are static.



const number1 = Math.random()
console.log(number1)

const number2 = Math.floor(10.3)
console.log(number2)


const number3 = Math.ceil(121.3)
console.log(number3)


const base = 2
const expand = 4

const number4 = Math.pow(base,expand)
